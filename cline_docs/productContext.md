# Product Context

## Purpose
react-jsonschema-form is a React and React Native component library that uses JSON Schema to declaratively build and customize forms. It provides a powerful way to generate forms from JSON Schema specifications, making it easier for developers to create complex form interfaces across web and mobile platforms.

## Problems Solved
1. Reduces boilerplate code needed to create forms
2. Standardizes form generation using JSON Schema
3. Provides consistent form validation through JSON Schema
4. Enables easy form customization and theming
5. Supports multiple UI frameworks and platforms
6. Handles platform-specific form implementations

## How It Works
1. Takes a JSON Schema as input to define form structure and validation rules
2. Renders form fields based on the schema's data types and formats
3. Handles form state management and validation
4. Supports custom widgets and field templates for customization
5. Provides theme packages for popular UI frameworks and platforms:
   - Ant Design
   - Bootstrap 3 & 4
   - Chakra UI
   - Fluent UI
   - Material UI 4 & 5
   - Semantic UI
   - React Native

## Key Features
