- Performance optimizations for form validation
- Error boundary improvements

## Upcoming
- Keyboard handling improvements
- Accessibility support
- Integration tests
- Documentation updates for new features

## Decisions
- FileWidget implementation skipped
  * Not suitable for React Native's mobile context
  * File handling better suited to platform-specific methods
  * Mobile apps typically use camera/gallery pickers instead
- Web widgets removed
  * Project focused on React Native only
  * All widgets use native components
  * Platform-specific optimizations
